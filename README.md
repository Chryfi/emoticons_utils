# Functionalities

**Mixamo to Emoticons converter**

You can convert Mixamo rigs to Emoticons rigs. You just import the FBX file of mixamo and the emoticons rig and select them in the menu. Every button has a tooltip for further explanations.

**Apply morph trackers**

This is for morph trackers exported by the Aperture mod. If you track an emoticons morph, you can use this functionality to automatically attach an emoticons rig to the individual limb trackers. This is especially helpful if you want to track a lot of emoticons morphs. The add-on will then copy the specified emoticons armature for the emoticons morphs trackers. The add-on basically does everything for you.

**IMPORTANT: the morph trackers in the emoticons morphs need to contain these keywords in order to be detected: 'low', 'arm', 'leg', 'left', 'right', 'body', 'anchor', 'end', 'head'**
